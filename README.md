# Markdown Online

This is a very simple online markdown editor.

It's based on [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/) and [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).

The build tool is [Vite](https://vite.dev/), and the package manager is [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

Use Highlight.js for syntax.
